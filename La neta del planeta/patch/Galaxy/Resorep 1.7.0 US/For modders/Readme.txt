This folder contains export settings for Intel(R) DDS Plugin for Photoshop for various texture formats.

These settings are not mandatory. It's only my best guess. So you can try different settings if these do not work for you.

If there is no corresponding file then I have no idea how to save to that format using Intel(R) DDS Plugin for Photoshop. 
Actually modded texture could be of different format than original one so you may try to save modded texture to different format.
