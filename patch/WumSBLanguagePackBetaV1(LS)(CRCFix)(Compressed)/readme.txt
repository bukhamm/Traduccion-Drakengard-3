Extra zip files are for making this mod compatible with Renewation and Mod Boludo. If you don't have these mods, just ignore these zip files.

There is also an optional pack that adds the Worms 3D Russian version soundbanks. You can ignore it if you are not interested.

This game has a CRC check that verifies if any game files have been modified. If any modifications are detected, the game shuts down. Thatâ€™s why this mod includes an executable that bypasses this verification, allowing any mods to be installed.
